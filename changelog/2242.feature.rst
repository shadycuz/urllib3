Added support for configuring header merging behavior with HTTPHeaderDict

When using a ``HTTPHeaderDict`` to provide headers for a request, by default duplicate
header values will be repeated. But if ``combine=True`` is passed into a call to
``HTTPHeaderDict.add``, then the added header value will be merged in with an existing
value into a comma-separated list (``X-My-Header: foo, bar``).
